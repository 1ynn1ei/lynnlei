<hr>
<h2>the goal</h2>
<p>i required a website. something that would push back, just a tiny bit,
against the monolithic web 2.0 social media black hole. i wanted something
that was easy to maintain, easy to add to, and was free of the javascript bloat
that is so prevalent.</p>
<p>static site generation was the solution i found. it also has the added benefit of
being quite cheap to host! i tried a few frameworks to generate static websites,
but they all left a bad taste in my mouth. mostly the 'framework' part, or the
<code>npm run build</code> part. i wanted to work on this website from the comfort of my
daily driver, the x220 thinkpad, and i did not want to install node on this poor
thing. that left me with the obvious choice: write it myself, and in rust!</p>
<h2>the process</h2>
<p>static site generators already exist in the rust ecosystem such as
<a href="https://cobalt-org.github.io/#" rel="noopener noreferrer">cobalt</a> or <a href="https://getzola.org#" rel="noopener noreferrer">zola</a>. unfortunately
i have an obsession with understanding how the systems i use, work. this means we have to
start from scratch. or, as close to scratch as i feel comfortable. we're still going to use
a few tools.</p>
<h3>pull down that mark down</h3>
<p>my goal of both ease of use, as well as ease of addition, i went with markdown. specifically the
<a href="https://commonmark.org#" rel="noopener noreferrer">common mark</a> variant. all pages of the website are then stored as
markdown files, and ingested using the
<a href="https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latestl/pulldown_cmark/index.html#" rel="noopener noreferrer">pulldown-cmark</a> crate. the
real strength of this crate is our access to the parser, so i can do post-processing to make
my life just a little bit easier. the best example is the code for parsing blog posts, where i need
to extract the title of the blog so i can add it to the page title:</p>
<pre><code>let mut title = String::new();
let mut content = String::new();
let parser = Parser::new_ext(&amp;file_content, Options::ENABLE_HEADING_ATTRIBUTES);
let parser = parser
    .map(|event| match event {
        Event::Text(ref text) =&gt; {
            if title.is_empty() {
                title = text.clone().into_string()
            }
            event
        },
        _ =&gt; event
});
html::push_html(&amp;mut content, parser.into_iter());
content = content: PreEscaped(ammonia::clean(&amp;content));
</code></pre>
<p>in the above snippet i am looping over the entire markdown document, looking for the first instance
of a text element and grabbing that as the title. this is almost always the first h1 element. an
example markdown file would be:</p>
<pre><code># Static Site Generation in Rust

## the goal
i required a website. something that would push back, just a tiny bit,
against the monolithic web 2.0 social media black hole. i wanted something
that was easy to maintain, easy to add to, and was free of the javascript bloat
that is so prevalent. 
</code></pre>
<p>after parsing, it would have extracted the title as "Static Site Generation in Rust" while preserving the entiretiy of
the content. The <code>PreEscaped</code> structure is part of the next section, which aids in turning this
markdown into HTML.</p>
<p>there is an appearance of another crate here,
<a href="https://docs.rs/ammonia/latest/ammonia.index.html#" rel="noopener noreferrer">ammonia</a>, which i use just to clean up any
black-listed html elements that may exist in the markdown files. since this website gets generated
automatically, it protects against some basic XSS attacks if an attacker were to inject their own
markdown file before compilation. this is very unlikely, but it's always nice to do best practices.</p>
<h3>html generation</h3>
<p>i could write html string literals all through my code, but i found a much more clean
solution:
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html#" rel="noopener noreferrer">proc macros</a>.
if you've used rust at all, you're probably most familiar with the <code>println!</code> proc macro
(i'll leave it up to you to look up the code that particular one expands into!) needless
to say, they are quite powerful. our entire html generation for this project is driven by
<a href="https://maud.lambda.xyz#" rel="noopener noreferrer">maud</a> which is one such powerful proc macro. here is how i use it
to generate this very page:</p>
<pre><code>html! {
    (DOCTYPE)
    meta charset="utf-8";
    link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css";
    title {
        @if let Some(htitle) = htitle {
            "lynnlei"
                "::"
            (htitle)
        }
    }
    main {
        (content)
    }
    footer {
        "Built on rust, Powered by maud, Cleaned by ammonia"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>content</code> and <code>title</code> in this macro are provided from the previous snippet of code parsing
our markdown files. there isn't much more to say here: if you are interested in how this expands
out into html, i would recommend grabbing the crate for yourself and playing around! or, you could
check the html structure of this very website.</p>
<h2>the result</h2>
<p>you're looking at it! you can find all the code <a href="https://github.com/1ynn1ei/lynnlei.git#" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3>next steps</h3>
<p>first, i'd like to move the build process from using a simple <code>glob</code> search to using a <code>Makefile</code>.
a Makefile would allow me to leverage things such as checking if files have changed before building
them, easily moving static files, and easily making the necessary directories while giving a <code>clean</code>
option that is much needed while i do testing.</p>
<p>i'm also doing my best to resist the pull to write my own markdown parser. there is absolutely no
reason to do this, but i have a preternatural desire to read spec documents and construct parsers.
in order to sate this desire, i would really love to write a simple parser for any code blocks on
my website to add simple syntax highlighting, such as italicized comment blocks and colorizing simple
elements such as strings and functions. keep an eye out for this inevitable project.</p>
