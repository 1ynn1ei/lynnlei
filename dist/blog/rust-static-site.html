<!DOCTYPE html><meta charset="utf-8"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"><title>lynnlei::Static Site Generation in Rust</title><main><h1>Static Site Generation in Rust</h1>
<h2>Header 2</h2>
<p>We used some code to make this work:</p>
<pre><code>html! {
    (DOCTYPE)
    meta charset="utf-8";
    link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css";
    title {
        @if let Some(htitle) = htitle {
            "lynnlei"
                "::"
            (htitle)
        }
    }
    main {
        (content)
    }
    footer {
        "Built by rust, Powered by maud, Cleaned by ammonia"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and then we did some other things</p>
</main><footer>Built by rust, Powered by maud, Cleaned by ammonia</footer>
